                            So, I know that today is your birthday and (although you don't celebrate), I wanted to do something special.
                            So, I made a groupchat and forced (most) of your friends to participate in this gift!
                            One of your unique qualities is your fondness of voice messages.
                            Whether it be to teach us DnD build concepts or to ramble about life, these voice messages have not only made me believe you would be an excellent podcast host, but also set you apart as a both smart and intuitive person.
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <p class="owo">Because of this, I recruited our friends to make some voice messages of their own to wish you a happy birthday!
                            I then took their messages and coded a website where they could be looked back at and listened to whenever you forget just how awesome you are.
                            I hope these voice memos remind you just how much you mean to all of us.</p>

                        <p class="hi">Hey AJ, Maddie here (again)!
                            I know that you've been dealing with a lot, especially in these past few months.
                            Even with all those outside circumstances, you still find time to go out of your way and help all of us.
                            You are an incredible friend and someone I genuinely look up to and aspire to be like.
                            I can't recount every time I've spent on 6 hour voice calls with you talking about nothing and everything and just enjoying the time I get to spend with you.
                            Although you are a leader and intelligent individual, you also show an intuitive knack for problem solving both on an analytical and personal level.
                            You have helped all of us so much with anything and everything.
                            I look up to you: the person that always remains calm and cool even when hell breaks loose, freezes over, or whatever chaos that is our friendgroup.
                            On a personal level: I know that I have grown so much because of your guidance, advice, and even just the shoulder you have offered me to both laugh and cry on.
                            You once told me that time is one of the most important things, and that you'd never want to waste it.
                            Knowing that you spend that time with all of us means the world, and I can only hope that this gift shows even just a fraction of how much all of us, especially myself, appreciate you.
                            Happy birthday, AJ.</p>
