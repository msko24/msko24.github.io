              <h3>About the Coder</h3>
                <p>My name is Madeline Skopicki. I am a full time student at Boston University. I aim to continue my academic journey for the next four years and pursue an eventual masters in Computer Science with a minor in Education and Human Development. It is my ultimate goal to help impliment technology and learning in the most efficient way possible.</p>
                <p>Games could also act as a stimulator and help us to practice skills in real life</p>
