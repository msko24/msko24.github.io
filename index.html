                <h3>What are Videogames?</h3>
                <p>Videogames are electronic games typically played with a controller or a keyboard and mouse, or in more recent years, handheld consoles have become more popular.
                    Players are required to enter some sort of input to the game, resulting in different outcomes depending on the game, either progressing the game, or sending the player back to a previous point.
                    While these are just the basics of a video game, the range and depth of video games has grown rapidly over the years to accommodate and target all groups of people.</p>
